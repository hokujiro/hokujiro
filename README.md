# ☃︎ About Me:
Hi! I'm Pilar, a Computer Engineer based in Spain, currently crafting Android apps by day and building meaningful tools by night (sometimes the other way around ☕️).

Right now, I'm developing an app for people who struggle with motivation to help them build a lasting organizational habit with the tools that motivational psychology has given us.

It's Android-first, but iOS and Web is definitely in the plans.

This method isn't just theory — it's something I've refined over years of helping myself and my friends keep going when motivation ran low. And I know it will help a lot more people.

🚀 I’m looking for collaborators who may be interested in this app :)

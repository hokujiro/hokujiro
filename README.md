# ðŸ’« About Me:
I'm Pilar, a Computer Engineer based in Spain. 
<br><br>I'm currently working professionally as an Android Engineer (>3 Years experience)
<br><br>I'm creating an application for people with motivational issues, to help them create an organization habit based on motivational theories. <br>First for Android, then for iOS. 

<br>I'm looking for collaborators :)

<br>The method behind it is something I've been building and mastering along the years, helping a lot of friends in the way, so I know this will be something big when it comes out in the light!<br><br>

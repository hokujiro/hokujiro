## Hi there üçé

I'm currently building a platform to help people with motivation issues, like myself, to push forward and be able to accomplish things for themselves.

I'm building the thing for Android first, using all of the knowledge that years of knowing myself and other people like me have taught me. 
(The "analogic" method has already helped many people, so I'm sure about this) 

I'm also creating a repository for all kinds of DSA patters (yeah you know why)

About me, I'm a computer engineer (27f) based in Spain. We are fucked economically down here so any help is welcomed.
